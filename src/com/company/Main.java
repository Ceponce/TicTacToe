    tic tac toe sudo code and thoughts...

    here we go...

    First:
        we will need recursion... yes. But what will be the layout?
        Probably continue the use of a string... it will be the key and
        the solution will be the definition.


        key as... String str = "012345678"

        -the values in the string are going to be ... {-1, 0, 1}

            -this way we know the value of our game.
            -we need to develop checking methods.
            -set up our red alert method
            -set up opponents red alert system. (this needs to be optimized)

            -Ultimately we will want to put the other player in multiple red alerts at the same time.
            -we need to be careful on maximizing our red alerts. they can be dependent on one node and
             that is unacceptable. It needs to be like the evil hangman where, we have lots of red alerts,
             we play the spot that will lead to more secure multiple red alerts.

        - we will probably start at "-10000000000"

            -to get the hang of a game.
            -computer starts
            -client will do smart moves "attempt to avoid red alert scenario's"

        - order of priorities

            -if winning opportunity... take win
            -if red alert... block it
            -else optimize victory (optimize opponents red alerts)
